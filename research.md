# Research

My research encompasses three main strands: (1) the role of schooling and work-based learning in shaping students’ trajectories and transitions into the labor market; (2) the ways in which education influences individuals’ sense of identity and the formation of attitudes—particularly those related to civic engagement; and (3) the impact of career intentions, work environments, and organizational structures on the development and effectiveness of early childhood education (ECE) professionals. Across these strands, I apply advanced quantitative and computational methods—including causal inference, item response theory, and natural language processing—and integrate multimodal (text and image-based) as well as longitudinal data.
