# About Me

I am a Strada Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Irvine. I obtained my PhD in Education with a focus on Education Policy and in Data Science from the University of California, Berkeley.

My research and teaching interests are related to student trajectories (including college to career), causal inference, ethnicity in Latin America, and teachers' working environments.
