# About Me

![Profile Picture](assets/profile.jpg)

I am a Strada Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Irvine. I obtained my PhD in Education with a focus on Education Policy and in Data Science from the University of California, Berkeley.

I am particularly interested in understanding the policies and practices that promote effective labor market transitions—such as work-based learning—and the organizational factors that influence educator turnover. I also examine whether and how curricular policies shape opinions and attitudes that foster civic engagement and identity formation. Methodologically, I combine machine learning techniques (including natural language processing and facial recognition algorithms) with econometric approaches. My research draws on diverse data sources, including text-based materials (open-ended responses, textbooks, and web-scraped data), administrative records, and survey data. I also have an interest in better understanding Item Response Theory, so if you want to collaborate, please let me know!
